    "Efficient public transit systems play a pivotal role in enhancing mobility, reducing carbon footprints, and fostering sustainable city growth. In many American cities, there is an ongoing and concerted effort to improve multi-modal transit and build better transit systems that supplement, or replace, the predominantly car-oriented infrastructure. Often these transit system improvements are subject to scrutiny, as urban rail projects require an extensive up-front investment of public money.\n",
    "Within many transit agencies financial constraints exist and officials are often hesitant to allocate significant public funds for long-term projects. This hesitancy is intensified by the potential for unexpected expenses that could jeopardize an entire project. There's a pressing need for a transparent tool that provides accurate cost assessments for urban rail projects that doesn't rely on the participation of government officials.\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis aims to provide community members, local officials, and advocates with realistic construction cost estimates for passenger rail projects, tailored to the specific constraints of individual communities. Such a tool could help optimize public fund allocation and bridge the gap between political decision-making and community needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this analysis was to examine existing data on the construction costs of train lines to develop a predictive model capable of estimating the total cost of such projects. The endeavor produced two primary outputs:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A specialized model intended for professionals, such as engineers, familiar with particular locales.\n",
    "2. A general-use model, designed for anyone keen on gauging transit project expenses.\n",
    "\n",
    "By doing so, I hope to contribute to the creation of more efficient, timely, and cost-effective transit projects that better serve the needs of urban populations globally. There are several important metrics to track and within this sheet I will outline the data that will be used in the analysis."

The Transit Costs Project has provided their own analysis of the data, which can be found on their [analysis page](https://transitcosts.com/new-data/). I intend to build upon their analysis to build a tool that provide a baseline cost estimate to help estimate the overall cost for a project, given some information about the project area.\n",

The original research team, for the purposes of compiling a trustworthy dataset, left several items blank if they could not verify their true values from official sources. I opted to backfill these datapoints by using a variety of techniques that, I feel, provided me with a suitable approximation. It's worth noting that many of these techniques are imperfect and should be viewed as a potential sources of errors. I'll discuss the techniques used in the the data cleaning section of this analysis.\n",
